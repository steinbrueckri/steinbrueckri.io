Hey! I'm Richard, a DevOps Engineer at [Lime-Connect](https://lime-connect.com) where I make things work smoothly. When I'm not automating everything in sight, I'm helping out at [carolin.photography](https://carolin.photography) because photography is where my heart actually lives.

The streets are my canvas. Every corner, every face, every moment tells a story. I capture the raw, unfiltered beauty of everyday life through street photography – no posing, no staging, just pure authentic moments frozen in time.

## ⚡ Some fun facts about me

- Terminal is my happy place, GUI is overrated 😅
- Typing on a Kinesis Advantage Keyboard ⌨️
- Everything should be automated, because life is too short to repeat yourself ⚡️
- If I leave the office, then only with Frank 🐶 and my Fujifilm X-T3 📸
